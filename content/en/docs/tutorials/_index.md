## What Makes a Tutorial?

Tutorials are **learning-oriented**. They:

- ✅ Take you through a series of steps to complete a project
- ✅ Teach you skills and concepts along the way
- ✅ Are designed for beginners or those new to a topic
- ✅ Ensure you achieve success
- ✅ Build confidence through hands-on experience

Tutorials are **not**:
- ❌ Problem-solving guides (see [How-To Guides](../how-to/))
- ❌ Technical specifications (see [Reference](../reference/))
- ❌ Conceptual explanations (see [Explanations](../explanation/))

## Next Steps

After completing the tutorial, you can:
- Browse [How-To Guides](../how-to/) for specific tasks
- Explore the [Scenarios Catalog](../reference/scenarios/) for all available chaos tests
- Read [Explanations](../explanation/) to deepen your understanding
- Check the [Developer's Guide](../developers-guide/) to contribute
