Krkn Dashboard is the visualization and control layer of the krkn-hub ecosystem. It provides an intuitive web interface that allows users to configure, trigger, and monitor Chaos experiments with ease. Through real-time logs, dynamic filters, and summarized results, users can gain insights into system behavior under stress. The dashboard simplifies chaos engineering workflows by making them more accessible and manageable through a user-friendly UI.

## Getting Started
To install and run the Krkn Dashboard, you can either use the containerized version via Docker or Podman, or run it locally by cloning the repository.
Follow the setup instructions in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/_index.md#krkn-dashboard) guide to configure the environment and launch the dashboard.
