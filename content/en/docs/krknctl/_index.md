`Krknctl` is a tool designed to run and orchestrate [krkn](krkn.md) chaos scenarios utilizing 
container images from the [krkn-hub](krkn-hub.md). 
Its primary objective is to streamline the usage of `krkn` by providing features like:

- Command auto-completion
- Input validation
- Scenario descriptions and detailed instructions

and much more, effectively abstracting the complexities of the container environment. 
This allows users to focus solely on implementing chaos engineering practices without worrying about runtime complexities.
