This scenario is based on the hog [hog-plugin-stressng](https://github.com/arcalot/hog-plugin-stressng) plugin. 
The purpose of this scenario is to create disk pressure on a particular node of the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster for a time span.
The scenario allows to attach a node path to the pod as a `hostPath` volume.
