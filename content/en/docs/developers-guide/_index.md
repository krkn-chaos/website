This document describes how to develop and add to Krkn. Before you start, it is recommended that you read the following documents first:

1. [Krkn Main README](../krkn/_index.md)
2. [List of all Supported Scenarios](../scenarios/_index.md)

Be sure to properly [install](../installation/_index.md) Krkn. Then you can start to develop krkn. The following documents will help you get started:

1. [Add k8s functionality to krkn-lib](./krkn-lib.md)
2. [Add a New Chaos Scenario using Plugin API](./scenario_plugin_api.md): Adding a new scenario into krkn
3. [Test your changes](./testing-changes.md) 


`NOTE: All base kubernetes functionality should be added into krkn-lib and called from krkn`

Once a scenario gets added to krkn, changes will be need in krkn-hub and krknctl as well. See steps below on help to edit krkn-hub and krknctl
- [Add New Scenario to Krkn-hub](./editing-krkn-hub.md) and test your changes
- [Add New Scenario to Krknctl](./krknctl-edits.md) and test your changes
