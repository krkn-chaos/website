Configuration for Chaos AI is managed through a simple YAML declarative file. This file can be auto-generated by using the Chaos AI's [dicover](../discover.md) mechanism which uses a boilerplate template to generate a config file. The generated config file will have the cluster components pre-populated based on the cluster.
