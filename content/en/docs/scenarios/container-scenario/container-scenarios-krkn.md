####  Example Config
The following are the components of Kubernetes for which a basic chaos scenario config exists today.

```yaml
scenarios:
- name: "<name of scenario>"
  namespace: "<specific namespace>" # can specify "*" if you want to find in all namespaces
  label_selector: "<label of pod(s)>"
  container_name: "<specific container name>"  # This is optional, can take out and will kill all containers in all pods found under namespace and label
  pod_names:  # This is optional, can take out and will select all pods with given namespace and label
  - <pod_name>
  count: <number of containers to disrupt, default=1>
  action: <kill signal to run. For example 1 ( hang up ) or 9. Default is set to 1>
  expected_recovery_time: <number of seconds to wait for container to be running again> (defaults to 120seconds)
```


## How to Use Plugin Name
Add the plugin name to the list of chaos_scenarios section in the config/config.yaml file
```yaml
kraken:
    kubeconfig_path: ~/.kube/config                     # Path to kubeconfig
    .. 
    chaos_scenarios:
        - container_scenarios:
            - scenarios/<scenario_name>.yaml
  ```
