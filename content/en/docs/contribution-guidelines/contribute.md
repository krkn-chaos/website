# How to contribute

Contributions are always appreciated.

How to:
* [Submit Pull Request](#pull-request)
* [Squash Commits](#squash-commits)
* [Rebase with Upstream](#rebase-with-upstream)
* [Certificate of Origin](#developers-certificate-of-origin)

## Pull request

In order to submit a change or a PR, please fork the project and follow instructions:
```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/<me>/krkn-hub
$ cd krkn-hub
$ git checkout -b <branch_name>
$ <make change>
$ git add <changes>
$ git commit -a
$ <insert good message>
$ git push
```

## Squash Commits
If there are mutliple commits, please rebase/squash multiple commits
before creating the PR by following:

```bash
$ git checkout <my-working-branch>
$ git rebase -i HEAD~<num_of_commits_to_merge>
   -OR-
$ git rebase -i <commit_id_of_first_change_commit>
```

In the interactive rebase screen, set the first commit to `pick` and all others to `squash` (or whatever else you may need to do).


Push your rebased commits (you may need to force), then issue your PR.

```bash
$ git push origin <my-working-branch> --force
```


## Rebase with Upstream
If new commits were merged while you were working you'll need to rebase with upstream
before creating the PR by following:

```bash
$ git checkout <my-working-branch>
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn (or krkn-hub)
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/<branch_in_upstream_to_rebase> (most likely `main`)
```

If any errors occur: 
1. Itâ€™ll list off any files that have merge issues
2. Edit the files with the code blocks you want to keep
3. Add and continue rebase 
```bash
$ git add .
$ git rebase --continue
```
4. Might need to repeat steps 1-3 until you see `Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/<my-working-branch>.`


Push your rebased commits (you may need to force), then issue your PR.

```bash
$ git push origin <my-working-branch> --force
```
