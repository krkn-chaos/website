## Performance dashboards

Krkn-chaos repository collection gives you a way to install a grafana on the cluster with dashboards loaded to help with monitoring the cluster for things like resource usage to find the outliers, API stats, Etcd health, Critical alerts etc. As well as specific metrics related to your krkn runs if elasticsearch is enabled. 

https://github.com/krkn-chaos/visualize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krkn-chaos/visualize
cd krkn-visualize

./deploy.sh 

OR 

./deploy.sh -c oc  # openshift installation
```

The dashboards can be edited/modified to include your queries of interest by logging in as the admin user. New dasbhoards can be imported using the import script and following directions defined [here](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/visualize?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-new-dashboard)

```bash
cd krkn-visualize
./import.sh -i ../rendered/<folder>/<dashboard_name>.json
```


**NOTE**: The dashboards leverage Prometheus for scraping the metrics off of the cluster and supports OpenShift automatically, but the user would need to install Prometheus on a kuberentes cluster before dashboards are deployed. Once Prometheus is setup on the cluster it'll leverage route objects to expose the grafana dashboards externally

If you don't have elasticsearch or prometheus installed on your cluster, you can use helm to help you deploy these services. See [these helpful commands](developers-guide/testing-changes.md#install-elasticsearch-and-prometheus) on how to install them
