##### Sample scenario config
```
pvc_scenario:
  pvc_name: <pvc_name>          # Name of the target PVC.
  pod_name: <pod_name>          # Name of the pod where the PVC is mounted. It will be ignored if the pvc_name is defined.
  namespace: <namespace_name>   # Namespace where the PVC is.
  fill_percentage: 50           # Target percentage to fill up the cluster. Value must be higher than current percentage. Valid values are between 0 and 99.
  duration: 60                  # Duration in seconds for the fault.
```

##### Steps
 - Get the pod name where the PVC is mounted.
 - Get the volume name mounted in the container pod.
 - Get the container name where the PVC is mounted.
 - Get the mount path where the PVC is mounted in the pod.
 - Get the PVC capacity and current used capacity.
 - Calculate file size to fill the PVC to the target fill_percentage.
 - Connect to the pod.
 - Create a temp file `kraken.tmp` with random data on the mount path:
    - `dd bs=1024 count=$file_size </dev/urandom > /mount_path/kraken.tmp`
 - Wait for the duration time.
 - Remove the temp file created:
    - `rm kraken.tmp`

### How to Use Plugin Name
Add the plugin name to the list of chaos_scenarios section in the config/config.yaml file
```yaml
kraken:
    kubeconfig_path: ~/.kube/config                     # Path to kubeconfig
    .. 
    chaos_scenarios:
        - pvc_scenarios:
            - scenarios/<scenario_name>.yaml
```
